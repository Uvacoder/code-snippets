# [My Code Snippets](https://code.nikitavoloboev.xyz)

This is a place where I keep snippets of code/notes I need reference of quickly. It is an extension of [my wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz).

The source of this [GitBook](https://code.nikitavoloboev.xyz) is on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/code)

You can access all snippets using search above or [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind).

## Contributing

If you found a mistake anywhere, I would appreciate your help. GitBook provides a quick way to open GitHub page for any entry so you can make changes and submit a PR.

I'd love to hear any [ideas you have](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/code/issues/new) on how I can improve this repo.

## Thank you
